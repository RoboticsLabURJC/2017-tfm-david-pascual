Hi there!

I'm David Pascual and this is the place where I will be writing down the latest advances in my master's thesis.

The main subject of this work is the real-time estimation of human poses in RGBD videos. We will evaluate several state-of-the-art methods for 2D and 3D pose estimation and implement a straight-forward pipeline for augmenting 2D poses into 3D.

This project is tutored by:
- [Jose María Cañas](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/)
- [Inmaculada Mora](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/inmaculada.mora)
