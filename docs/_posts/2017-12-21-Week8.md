In order to get closer to real-time prediction, we've been testing how image size influence both execution time and performance. We can experiment with different image sizes tuning **```boxsize``` parameter**, defined in CPMs configuration file. Before testing different box sizes, I have analyzed how the sample that goes through the model changes until the pose estimation is reached and how it depends on ```boxsize```.
1. **Original image** is resized according to ```boxsize```.
2. Human detector is fed with the **resized image**.
3. Human detector outputs a **heatmap** eight times smaller than its input because of pooling and convolutional layers stride.
4. The heatmap is **resized back** to the size of the image that fed the human detector.
5. With the human coordinates obtained from the heatmap, a **squared region** of size ```boxsize``` is cropped.
6. **Human box** is fed to the pose estimator.
7. Pose estimator outputs **joint coordinates** over an image eight times smaller than its input.
8. Finally, these joint coordinates are **transformed to fit full size image**.

All of these steps can be seen in the following diagram:

Originally, ```boxsize``` was equal to 384. These are the results obtained with different box sizes:

| Boxsize | Human detection (s) | Pose estimation (s) | Total (s) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 384     | 19.43               | 13.08               | 32.51     |
| 192     | 4.81                | 3.04                | 7.65      |
| 128     | 2.31                | 1.43                | 3.74      |
| 92      | 1.21                | -                   | -         |

As it can be seen, when we reduce size, we get a very significant speed-up, but predictions become less accurate or even non-existent. A good trade-off is reached with **192x192 ```boxsize```**: predictions are 4x times faster and they still being pretty accurate.
