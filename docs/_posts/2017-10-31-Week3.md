I've had troubles trying to install Caffe and its Python bindings. After going through a lot of tutorials, I managed to install it along with Anaconda for Python 2. I followed the instructions available in this GitHub gist: [CaffeInstallation.md by @arundasan91](https://gist.github.com/arundasan91/b432cb011d1c45b65222d0fac5f9232c).

Besides that, I have cloned both Caffe and TensorFlow repos and I'm trying to build a simple script for testing each one. These scripts are based on the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the repos. When I am able to feed forward samples through the CPMs and I fully understand how they work, we're going to build a JdeRobot component that can feed both models indistinctly from a webcam or a video file.
