In order to adapt the CPMs TensorFlow version (https://github.com/psycharo/cpm), I've been learning **TensorFlow basics** aided by the tutorials provided in its [webpage](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/). The code is going to follow the same structure than the Caffe version that I've already built and will be divided in human detection and pose estimation classes. At the moment, I've coded the <code>human_detector</code> class and I'm working in pose estimation. Whenever the code is finished, the TensorFlow model will be integrated within the ```humanpose``` component, that will be able to use both models indistinctly for pose estimation.
