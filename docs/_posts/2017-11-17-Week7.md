Last week I had troubles matching JdeRobot, Caffe and OpenCV dependencies. Finally, I've managed to build a stable environment.
1. I installed JdeRobot from Debian packages. As ROS is automatically installed as a JdeRobot dependency, OpenCV gets automatically installed too. Last time I tried to build JdeRobot, I already had built OpenCV from source, what got me some issues.
2. With JdeRobot and, consequently, OpenCV installed, I followed this tutorial to install Caffe library: [Installing Caffe on Ubuntu (CPU-ONLY)](https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Installing-Caffe-CPU-Only/)
Â¡And that's it! Undoubtedly, much easier and cleaner than the last time.

I have restructured my repo in order to develop the ```humanpose``` component, which will be based in last year's [```digitclassifier```](https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2016-tfg-david-pascual). Currently, the workload is divided in the following threads:
- **Camera**: it is responsible for capturing live video.
- **GUI**: it displays both live video and estimation results.
- **Estimator**: it loads the models when the component is executed. During execution, it gets a frame from ```Camera``` and estimates human pose. Then, estimation results are sent to ```GUI``` in order to visualize it. When the current estimation is finished, ```Estimator``` gets a new frame from Camera and the process starts again.

The idea is to show live video during execution and update estimation results only when Estimator throws new results. I'm currently working on it and I've uploaded to my repo its first version, but it stuck while an estimation is being made and GUI only updates whenever that estimation is done. In order to get faster results, I plan to reduce frames resolution. Meanwhile, here's a screenshot that has been taken while running the current version:
